\section{Introduction}
This document presents a detailed analysis of the WhatsApp group "Pakistan Monji," which focuses on agricultural discussions, particularly related to rice. The analysis delves into various types of interactions within the group, including the sharing of media, textual communications, and promotional activities. By examining these elements, this report aims to highlight the dynamics of communication, the relevance of shared content to the group's goals, and the engagement levels of its members.


\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Irrelevant Marketing Posts}
Despite the group's focus on agricultural information and discussions about rice, there are several messages that can be identified as marketing posts that do not align with the groupâ€™s main objective. Below are examples of such marketing posts identified in the provided text:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Message 7:} Promotes a special offer during Bari Eid, which, while loosely related to community celebrations, primarily serves as a sales tactic.
\item \textbf{Message 22:} Endorses SadaPay, a financial service unrelated to agriculture, highlighting a misalignment with the group's intended content.
\item \textbf{Message 39:} Announces an ``End Season Sale," which, despite its potential relevance to agricultural product clearing, primarily functions as a commercial sales pitch.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Group Invitations}
The group contains only 1 invite link to a WhatsApp group called ``Asia best rice and paddy corn group". This shows similar other groups are being promoted in the group.
